# Windy Live Wallpaper

Android live wallpaper visualizing local wind patterns.

Shaders and basic rendering logic are based on the official Pixel windy live wallpaper, but this also has:

- More color schemes.
- Updated wind data (the official data was last updated in 2019).
- Better location handling.
- Lower memory and CPU usage.
- Modernized code, updated libGDX.
- Other fixes.
